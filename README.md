# greenwood-library-website
Greenwood Community Library website enhancing with a book reviews section and updated community events page.

1. In this project I started by creating a remote repository on my gitHub account. After that, I cloned the repository into a folder I created using "mkdir".
I went ahead to create files which I added random things in, and a folder for my image.Then I proceded to stage,commit and push using the following commands; 


## git status
The git status command helps us see which changes have not been staged, and those that have been staged. It also shows which files are not being tracked by Git. I used it to see the changes that have not been staged yet.

To use this command we use the following syntax `git status`

![git](./img/1.%20git%20status.png)

## git add .
This command adds changes in the working directory to the staging area. I used it to stage the folders and files I have created.

![git](./img/2.%20git%20add%20..png)

## git commit -m 
This command saves the stagged changes in the repository with a descriptive message. I used it to save my stagged changes in the repository with my first commit message being "first commit".

![git commit -m](./Img/3.%20git%20commit%20-m.png)

## git push
I used this command to transfer commits from my local repository to my remote repository

![git push](./Img/4.%20git%20push.png)


## git checkout -b 
I used this command to create new branch for morgan called "add-book-reviews"

![git checkout -b](./Img/5.%20git%20checkout%20-b.png)

## touch
This command is used to create a file.
I added a file called book_reviews.html under the book-review branch then went ahead to add random text inside.

![touch](./Img/6.%20touch.png)

After creating the file, I proceded to staging, commiting and pushing the  changes using the following commands ; git add,git commit -m and git push  same commands above.

2. Following the above step I created a branch for Jamie using the git checkout -b update-events. Then I proceded to add a file to the update-events branch and added a random text inside the file.

3. After repeating the flow for Jamie's work, I pulled the latest changes from the main branch into the update-events directory using;
## git pull origin add-book-reviews
![git pull origin](./Img/7.%20git%20pull%20origin%20add-book-reviews.png)

So I went ahead to stage, commit, and push
